Secure admin login system
Dashboard: provides a brief overview of total registered users, total inquiries, total mechanics, and total services

Vehicle Category: manage vehicle categories by adding, deleting, and updating them
Reg Users: view and update user details

Customer Query: respond to customer queries and view both responded and non-responded queries
Enquiry Search: search inquiries using customer phone numbers, email IDs, or contact numbers
Service Search: search services using customer phone numbers, email IDs, or contact numbers
User: Key features:
